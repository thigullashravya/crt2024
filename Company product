The company want to have an algorithm for their system which takes the product type and outputs the tag. To generate the tag, pairs of adjacent characters are formed from the start of the uct type . From each pair the lexicographically smallest character will be removed. If a character will be left unpaired then that character will be taken as it is in the tag. Write an algorithm for the company system to find the tag for the given product.
